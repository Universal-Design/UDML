# 🤝 Contributing to UDML

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **UDML** — the Universal Design Markup Language!

We're building a shared, semantic vocabulary for describing user interfaces in a way that's **intuitive for designers**, **actionable for AI agents**, and **portable across platforms**. Your insights and input can help make UDML more complete, more useful, and more future-proof.

## 🧠 What We're Looking For

We're especially interested in contributions around:

### 📐 Design Language Improvements
- Proposing better ways to express layout, styles, or structure
- Suggestions for standardizing terminology across components
- Ideas for making the spec more expressive or easier to understand

### 🧩 New Components or Missing Patterns
- Adding components we’ve missed (e.g., advanced inputs, rich tables, animation primitives)
- Enhancing support for interaction or accessibility features
- Comparing patterns used in other design systems or tools

### 🔌 Integration Ideas
- Suggestions for how UDML could connect with Figma, design tokens, codegen tools, or AI workflows
- Ideas for plugins, tooling, or export pipelines

## 🛠 How to Contribute

1. **Start a discussion** – If you're not sure where to begin, head to the [Discussions](../../discussions) tab.
2. **Open an issue** – Report a bug, suggest a feature, or share a use case.
3. **Submit a pull request** – Propose changes to the spec or documentation. We’ll help guide the process.

> ✨ You don’t need to be an expert in design systems or AI to contribute — we welcome ideas, questions, and constructive feedback from all backgrounds.

## 📄 Format Guidelines

- Most of the spec is documented as individual `.md` files (one per component)
- Follow the structure used in existing specs: attributes table, usage examples, and AI guidelines
- Keep language clear and focused — our goal is readability for both humans and machines
